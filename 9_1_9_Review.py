# Review
#
# So far we have learned: 
# 	- How to create a dictionary
#		- How to add elements to a dictionary
#		- How to update elements in a dictionary
#		- How to use a dict comprehension to create a dictionary from two lists
#
# Let's practice these skills!

# Tasks!
# 
# 1. We are building a music streaming service (hell yea!). We have provided two
#    lists, representing songs in a user's library and the amount of times each song 
#    has been played. 
#
#		 Using a dict comprehension, create a dictionary called plays that goes through
#		 zip(songs, playcounts) and creates a song:playcount pair for each song in songs
#		 and each playcount in playcounts. 	
# 
# 2. Print plays
#
# 3. After printing plays, add a new entry to it. The entry should be for the song
#    "Purple Haze" and the playcount is 1. 
# 
# 4. This user has caught Aretha Franklin fever and listened to "Respect" 5 
#    more times.
#    Update the value for "Respect" to be 94 in the plays dictionary. 
#
# 5. Create a dictionary called library that has two key: value pairs:
#    - key "The Best Songs" with a value of plays, the dictionary you created
#    - key "Sunday Feelings" with a value of an empty dictionary
#
# 6. Print library.

songs = ["Like a Rolling Stone", "Satisfaction", "Imagine", "What's Going On", "Respect", "Good Vibrations"]
playcounts = [78, 29, 44, 21, 89, 5]

plays = {key:value for key, value in zip(songs, playcounts)}
print(plays)

plays.update({"Purple Haze": 1})
print(plays)

plays.update({"Respect": 94})
print(plays)

library = {"The Best Songs": plays, "Sunday Feelings": {}} 
print(library)
