# CodecademyPython
Learning Python! My takes on the Codecademy's Python course. 

## Deleted and restored...
Did a huuuge mistake with a git rm *, as i hoped it would only remove the files
I had removed from the working directoy (which was marked as deleted on git status). It def didnt, and removed everything in my entire folder. 
Luckily I did a old school backup on my local computer before I did this command. 
But it ended in me fixing it the opposite way. I'm sure theres a way I could 
just clone the repository back to my working folder, but ended with copying the files 
from my backup folder back to the working directory and pushed this... Sad, 
as it did remove all timestamps on all the files :/ I started this course
January 12, and more or less put up something every day since then. 

## Todos 
* Rename files...
Yea this is a mess. I started naming files a bit random, before i knew the 
course layout on Codecademy. 
* Make use of git
Hah, yea, been using GitHub as "dropbox", with literally uploading files 
manually. Doing the course on git/github as of lat feb, and will continue 
to use that from now (feb 24 2022). Now it should be easier to do the re-
naming.
