# CodecademyPython
Learning Python! My takes on the Codecademy's Python course. 

## Todos 
* Rename files...
Yea this is a mess. I started naming files a bit random, before i knew the 
course layout on Codecademy. 
* Make use of git
Hah, yea, been using GitHub as "dropbox", with literally uploading files 
manually. Doing the course on git/github as of lat feb, and will continue 
to use that from now (feb 24 2022). Now it should be easier to do the re-
naming.
