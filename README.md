Learning Python! My takes on the Codecademy's Python course

As title and described above. Diving into Python with Codecademy and will dump most of it here. I did run the first 3 already, so might just be from chap 4 and up.

Edit:
As I started to name all these files, unaware of how the course structure was built up, i did see it smart to rename - not only once but several times. This makes
this folder look very messy. I will probably take my time to clean it up a bit better at the end.
